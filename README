This repo contains scripts that I use to migrate music (flacs) into iTunes. Then I sync the iTunes folder to my phone.

Usage is:
  flac2mp3 /path/to/dir/containing/flacs
  sync_music

How it works:
  flac2mp3 will generate mp3s from flac files and write the id3 tags to the generated mp3 files.
  Then it dumps the mp3 files into the iTunes "Automatically Add to iTunes.localized" directory.

There are a bunch of hard coded paths that you may want to check.
